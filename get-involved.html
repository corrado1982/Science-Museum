            There are various ways you can support the 
            museum. Donations are very welcome and are 
            an important way we keep this museum open 
            and accessible to the whole community. 
            You can also support us by donating items
            of interest to the museum’s collections.
            If you have some item or collection 
            that you think others would enjoy, 
            please let us know by contacting our 
            Collections Department and they will
            be able to assist you.

        <p> <strong>Volunteer</strong>  <br><br>
            

            A number of people volunteer their time and
            effort to keep the displays in good order 
            and ready for visitors to come and enjoy.
            Volunteering has its perks including 
            getting to see behind the scenes of a
            working museum, access to staff-only 
            lectures, and a monthly lunch where all 
            staff and volunteers come together to
            discuss ideas for future exhibits and 
            strategies for the museum.
            You can help volunteer in a number of 
            different spheres. Please contact us if 
            you’d like to find out more about how you 
            can get involved.
