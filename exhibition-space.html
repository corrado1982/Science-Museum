        <p> <strong> Cosmology </strong> <br> <br>

            Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition,
            ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky and what we can see
            and know about the universe around us. We’ll locate the various
            constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about the 
            early navigators who used the stars to travel by. Follow the journey
            of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders, to Galileo’s telescope,
            to the latest exploration of the planets in our solar system.

        <p> <strong> Evolution </strong> <br> <br>
            For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with
             the question of our origins. Where do we come from and how 
             did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of 
             evolution we have had a framework for exploring and
              understanding our place in this world.
            Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the
             species we know today have evolved our time. You can also 
             take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t
              survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a
               number of dinosaurs too.

        <p> <strong> Biology and Medicine </strong> <br> <br>
            From micro-organisms to the human body, major 
            breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique 
            insights into the great wonders of the tiny world. 
            For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their 
            quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our 
            understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore
            the history of medicine and take a look at some major
            breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the 
            first heart transplant. 
            Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from
            the lab, but also from observing animals in the wild. Often
            our fellow creatures have beat us to it.

        <p> <strong> Robotics and AI </strong> <br> <br>
            The information revolution is here and robotics
             and artificial intelligence
            are the science of the future. From useful home applications
            of AI to
            industrial uses of robotics, the future is here. You can even
            say hello
            and shake the hand of Rob the Robot.

        <p> <strong> Ecology </strong> <br> <br>
            As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the 
            planet, the more important it becomes that scientists explore how to 
            create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole planet.
            In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we 
            currently face including global warming, extinction of species, and 
            pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways we can all contribute 
            to a brighter future.
